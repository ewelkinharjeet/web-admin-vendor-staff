                    <p>After every trip to Hawaii, I always have a few DMs asking where we stayed, our favorite beaches, etc. Especially with spring break around the corner, I wanted to share a recap of our trip a couple weeks ago. (I’ve shared a few recaps of where we’ve stayed and our favorite activities when we went as a family – this trip was more of an adult trip but I have multiple posts with guides on past Hawaii trips: a Maui Travel Guide, Oahu Family edition, and more of our Oahu faves here.) </p>
                    <p>Since I’ve shared a lot of our favorites in the past posts, I’m just going to highlight my favorites from this trip like what to eat, where to stay, and where to play (like beaches, hikes, etc.)</p>
